# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I have been inspired by others, like many before me. 

In particular, I have been inspired by ny friend [@jlndk](https://girhub.com/jlndk). [Check out his files here](https://github.com/jlndk/dotfiles)

## Installation
Until I have a script for it, just copy or symlink what you like into your ~/.config folder from config and into ~/.script from script.
